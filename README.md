# CS210-Project-1-

the purpose of this assignment was to simulate writing a time keeping application for a company named Chada Tech, I was to write out a program that display a clock in a 24 hour representation similar to how a clock would be displayed on a pc
however, the difference being it was only to simulate the said clock not to make a working clock that updated in real time. It needed to be able to differentiate between AM and PM and have hours, minutes, and seconds defined.
